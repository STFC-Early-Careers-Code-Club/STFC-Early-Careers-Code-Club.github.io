## Style Conventions

### Commits

Commits should begin with the most appropriate prefix from the list below

| Commit Type | Commit Prefix |
| --- | --- |
| Adding new features | `feat:` | 
| Content updates | `feat(content):` |
| Bug fixes | `fix:` |
| Maintenance & non-code updates | `chore:` |
| Style formatting | `style:` |
| Refactoring | `refactor:` |
| Documentation updates | `docs:` |
| Testing | `test:` |

e.g. a commit that adds a new talk would look like this: `feat(content): add content for <TALK_TITLE>`

### Pull Requests

Pull requests, like commits, should be prefaced with the prefix that most describes the changes made.

e.g. a pull request that adds a new talk would look like this: `feat(content): Add <TALK_TITLE> talk content`
