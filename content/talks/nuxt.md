description: Live demo of setup of a Nuxt 3 project and some of its features.
---

This talk was an adhoc live demo of setting up a Nuxt 3 project and exploring some of its features and for this reason there is no content here.

Regardless, if you want to get started with Nuxt yourself, there is lots of documentation available online:

- [Vue Interactive Tutorial](https://vuejs.org/tutorial/) - a great way to get started with Vue.js, which Nuxt is built on.
- [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation) - the official Nuxt documentation is comprehensive and well-maintained.
